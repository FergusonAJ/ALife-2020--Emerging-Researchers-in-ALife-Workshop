# Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life Workshop 2020
The Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA) is the International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL) official student, post-doc, and junior researcher group. 
The purpose of the ISAL student group is to provide opportunities for students and post-docs interested in artificial life to interact with each other, develop professionally, and contribute to the broader artificial life community.
This workshop will serve as 
(1) a general informational meeting and discussion for members and prospective members of the ERA, 
(2) a venue for the recipient of the 2020 ISAL Outstanding Student Publication Award to present their work, 
and (3) a platform for junior researchers to meet, share their work, and network.
After the workshop, we will compose a brief summary of the general meeting and contributed talks to be made publicly available over the web (_e.g._, as a blog post on the ISAL website). 

The workshop will begin with a brief informational discussion about ERA, including an introduction by the current elected chairs, an overview on how to get involved in the group, discussions of events and activities junior researchers would like to see organized by the group, and a request for nominations for 2020-2021 ERA chairs. 
Additionally, we will announce any upcoming ERA-organized social events planned during the conference. Following this general discussion, we will highlight the recipient of the 2020 ISAL Outstanding Student Paper Award, inviting them to present their work. 
To give junior ALife researchers a minimal-barrier-to-entry venue to share their research with peers, we will offer sign-ups to give lightning talks on research at any stage of development, ranging from rough ideas for future projects to already published work. This style of lightning talks for students was successful at the 2017 European Conference on Artificial Life. Our workshop will conclude with ALife-themed academic karaoke, an entertaining social activity where participants present an unknown (to the presenter) series of ALife-themed slides.
